HOW TO PERFORM A DEMO SIMULATION:

Our code is on robot.py, but the executable is main.py

Execution steps:

    1. Open CoppeliaSim
    2. Open simulation_scene.ttt
    If it's the first time you execute the simulation, you have to train the neural network.
    to do it execute OCR use.py, don't worry if it takes a while. Once finished you will find a new file called MLP.joblib, that's the neural network
    3. Run the coppelia scene
    4. Run main.py
