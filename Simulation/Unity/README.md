# How to run the Unity simulation

You have 2 options to run it:

* If you do not want to compile any code, you can just run the executable file without compiling. You only have to [download it](Windows%20executable%20build.zip), unzip it and double click on it to run the simulation.

* But if you want to modify the simulation, you will need to compile the C# code inside Unity. To do this you have another 2 options:

    * The fastest option is to [download the unitypackage file](warehouse_simulation_export.unitypackage) and import it into a new Unity scene. That will import the entire project, including the code, the warehouse, and the robots. Then you can play the scene or build it to compile and export your modifications.

    * If you do not want to import the entire project, you have the option to download the specific parts of the project you want from the [Unity project folder](/Warehouse%20simulation).
