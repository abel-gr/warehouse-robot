# Warehouse Robot

Our robot works around a warehouse moving and organizing the inventory. We have implemented a simulation in Unity with some more robots to work in swarms so the tasks are efficiently distributed.

Each robot is formed by a base capable of moving thanks to a set of wheels. This base carries a structure with an arm. The armâ€™s job will be to pick up the packages and drop them in a basket structure located rear the arm , so it is able to carry more than one package at the same time. It has a GPS sensor so it is able to know where it is located at every moment, a camera to use computer vision techniques to recognize the texts of the boxes and a remote wifi connection to receive tasks. We also have designed a website where are stored the warehouse orders, and a human worker can add manually and also with his/her own voice orders to be processed by the robots swarm.
